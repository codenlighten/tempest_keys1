# tempest_keys1
This implementation is built using new openssl sha256 algorithm and libbitcoin library for generating private public keys and signing hash of user data
This can be adapted to hash data, sign it, and then send off to blockchain api

# you can install libbitcoin using install.sh script
for use on ESP32, we might have to use other libraries that are lightweight.
